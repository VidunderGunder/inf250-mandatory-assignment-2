## ‚ú® Results

### Images

I spent *some* time tuning the parameters to get the best result for each operator/method, but this could obviously be done more thoroughly. 

#### Edge detection

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>prewitt</th>
    <th>sobel</th>
    <th>canny</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./output/prewitt.png"></td>
    <td><img src="./output/sobel.png"></td>
    <td><img src="./output/canny.png"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Sharpening

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>la_place</th>
    <th>usm</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./output/la_place.png"></td>
    <td><img src="./output/usm.png"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Discussion

_Note: I assume the assignment wants us to discuss edge detection, as discussing sharpness seems a bit out of place when looking at the resulting images from all methods/operators (both functions), except USM._

_Also, it is not clear for what purpose the sharpening will be used (aesthetics, image analysis, clarity for inspection by humans etc.), so it is hard to know what could be considered "best"._

_I will discuss the performance of edge detection for use in image analysis where object detection is the goal below:_

- There was not a huge difference between results using a small amount of gaussian blur or not in my testing, but it did filter out some irrelevant details that is not considered the edge of an object.
- Canny gives us a binary result of wether something is a edge or not. It can be used as for crude edge detection, but a lot of detail and information is lost, and it is hard to process further
- Prewitt, Sobel and Laplace (with the current config) gives us more of a probability of something being an edge and will need further processing if we need a binary result. This approach retains much information, and the resulting image is comprehensible for humans.   
- USM with the current config is basically useless for edge detection. As OpenCV recommends blurring images for edge detection, I don't see how it could be used in conjunction with the other algorithms to perform better edge detection either.

### Best performer

To my eyes and with my parameter tweaking, Laplace seems the most suited for edge detection.
